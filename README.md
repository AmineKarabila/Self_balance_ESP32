# Self_balance_ESP32
A module consisting of one:

-> ESP32 (microcontroller)(`<br>`)
-> ADXL345 (position sensor)(`<br>`)
-> 775 motor (`<br>`)
-> BTS7960 motor driver(`<br>`)
-> 24V power plug (`<br>`)

By means of the module, each bicycle should become a self-balancing bicycle by attaching the module to the bicycle like a bell in order to make the bicycle drive itself. 

For the programming I used the Espressif IoT Development Framework ESPIDF.
