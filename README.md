# Self_balance_ESP32
A module consisting of one:

-> ESP32 (microcontroller) \n
-> ADXL345 (position sensor)
-> 775 motor 
-> BTS7960 motor driver
-> 24V power plug 

By means of the module, each bicycle should become a self-balancing bicycle by attaching the module to the bicycle like a bell in order to make the bicycle drive itself. 

For the programming I used the Espressif IoT Development Framework ESPIDF.
